This directory contains the scripts used to create a BLAST database (Slurm-PMBlastDB) using specific genes (gyrA, gyrB, parC, and parE) and then BLAST the sequences (Slurm-PMBlastSeqs) using the newly created database. Once this was done the results of the blast were copied into one file (PM_Genes). These genes could then be downloaded locally and put in a multiple sequence alignment viewer such as Jalview. 

Pm64.txt and Pm3.txt are the genes used to create the database for the study "Leveraging of Machine Learning to Evaluate Genotypic-Phenotypic Concordance of Pasteurella Multocida Isolated from Bovine Respiratory Disease Cases."

Pm64.txt contains the resistant PM isolates and Pm3.txt contains the susceptible PM isolates.

Isolates used in this study can be found in BioProject PRJNA961659 and BioProject PRJNA306895 (these isolates are from the study completed by Owen et al. 2017 https://doi.org/10.1534/g3.117.1137).
