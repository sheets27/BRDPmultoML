Gene specific BLAST searches
All files and scripts within this directory were authored by Audrey Ellis and the original files and other work can be found at her github page github.com/AEllis123
The information found in this directory was used for creation of a BLAST database, BLAST search, and coping BLAST results into one file for multiple sequence alignments (MSA) for Pasteurella multocida (PM) and Mannheimia haemolytica (MH).

BLAST databases were created first using specific genes in .txt files. The results of the BLAST searches were then pulled for MSA.

NOTE: These projects were completed on Purdue University's computing clusters. Therefore, some parts of code may not pertain to your local machine when reading the Bash or R scripts.
